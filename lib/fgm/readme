Introduction 

This page contains software and instructions for Factorized Graph
Matching (FGM) [1]. In addition, we provide an implementation of the
spectral matching (SM) algorithm [2] as a baseline. All the functions
have been written and documented in Matlab format.

Installation
    1. unzip fgm.zip to your folder;
    2. Run make.m to compile all C++ files;
    3. Run addPath.m to add sub-directories into the path of Matlab.
    4. Run demoXXX file (e.g. demoToy, demoHouse).



Instructions
The package of aca.zip contains three folders, two setup files and three demo files.
    ./data: This folder contains motion capture data.
    ./src: This folder contains the main implmentation of ACA and HACA.
    ./lib: This folder contains some necessary library functions.
    ./make.m: Matlab makefile for C++ code.
    ./addPath.m: Adds the sub-directories into the path of Matlab.
    ./demoToy.m: Matching of two synthetic graph by FGM.
    ./demoHouse.m: Matching of two house images by FGM.
